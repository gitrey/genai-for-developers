### Description

The Balance Reader is a Spring Boot microservice responsible for providing real-time account balance information to authorized users. This service efficiently integrates with a centralized transaction ledger, ensuring consistent and accurate balance updates. It leverages a robust caching mechanism to enhance performance and minimize database interactions.

### Features

* **Real-time Balance Updates:** The service constantly monitors the transaction ledger and provides up-to-the-minute account balances.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Access to account balances is restricted to authorized users through a JWT-based authentication system.
* **Caching for Performance:** A Guava cache is implemented to store frequently accessed balances, significantly reducing latency for balance requests.
* **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Health checks are provided for monitoring the service's health and readiness to handle requests.
* **Metrics Monitoring:** Integration with Stackdriver allows for comprehensive monitoring of service performance and resource usage.
* **Spring Boot:** Built with Spring Boot for ease of development, deployment, and management.

### Architecture

The Balance Reader microservice follows a layered architecture:

**1. REST API:** Exposes endpoints for authorized users to retrieve account balances.
**2. Controller:** Handles incoming API requests, authenticates users, and interacts with the cache.
**3. Cache:** A Guava LoadingCache stores account balances, optimizing retrieval time.
**4. Ledger Reader:** Continuously polls the transaction ledger for new transactions.
**5. Database:** Persists transactions and account balances.
