## Balance Reader Microservice

This repository contains the code for the Balance Reader microservice. The microservice is responsible for tracking the bank balance for each user account and exposes an API for retrieving the balance for a given account.

### Description

The Balance Reader microservice is a simple Spring Boot application that uses a database to store the balance for each account. The microservice exposes a REST API endpoint that allows clients to retrieve the balance for a given account. The API requires authentication and authorization to ensure that clients can only access balances for accounts they are authorized to view. 

### Features

* **Account Balance Tracking:** The microservice tracks the balance for each account in a database.
* **REST API:** Exposes a REST API endpoint for retrieving the balance for a given account.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Uses JWT authentication to verify the identity of clients and authorization to restrict access to specific accounts.
* **Caching:** Uses a Guava cache to improve performance by caching frequently accessed account balances.
* **Metrics:** Exposes metrics for monitoring the health and performance of the microservice.
* **Tracing:** Supports tracing for debugging and troubleshooting.
* **Logging:** Uses Log4j2 for logging.
* **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Includes liveness and readiness probes for Kubernetes deployments.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/balance-reader.git
```

2. **Build the project:**
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Usage

1. **Deploy the microservice to Kubernetes:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

2. **Access the API:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" http://<SERVICE_HOSTNAME>/balances/<ACCOUNT_ID>
```

Replace `<JWT_TOKEN>` with a valid JWT token for the user and `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with the account ID.

### Architecture

The microservice is built using the following technologies:

* **Spring Boot:** Provides a framework for building REST APIs and managing dependencies.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Provides a convenient way to interact with a database using JPA.
* **Log4j2:** Used for logging.
* **JWT:** Used for authentication and authorization.
* **Guava Cache:** Used for caching account balances.
* **Micrometer and Stackdriver:** Used for exporting metrics.
* **Spring Cloud Sleuth:** Used for tracing.

The microservice uses a database to store account balances and a background thread to listen for new transactions. When a new transaction is detected, the microservice updates the balance for the affected accounts. 

### Security

The microservice uses JWT authentication to verify the identity of clients and authorization to restrict access to specific accounts. Clients must provide a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of their requests. 

### Monitoring

The microservice exposes metrics for monitoring its health and performance. These metrics can be collected by tools like Prometheus and Grafana. 

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the following resources:

* The documentation for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Log4j2, JWT, Guava Cache, Micrometer, Stackdriver, and Spring Cloud Sleuth.
* The GitHub repository for this project.

### Best Practices

The microservice follows industry best practices for building microservices, including:

* **Twelve-Factor App:** The microservice is designed to be a twelve-factor app.
* **Containerization:** The microservice is containerized using Docker.
* **API-First Development:** The microservice is designed with an API-first approach.
* **Microservice Architecture:** The microservice is designed to be a standalone microservice.
* **DevOps:** The microservice is built using DevOps principles.

### Future Enhancements

* Add support for multiple currencies.
* Improve performance by optimizing the database queries.
* Add support for transactions that involve multiple accounts.
* Implement a user interface for managing accounts.
* Integrate the microservice with other banking services.
